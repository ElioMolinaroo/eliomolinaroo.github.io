# About Me

Hey there! I'm a Rigging TD and programmer in the CG industry. I'm passionate about designing rigging systems that are fast and intuitive, both for rigging artists and animators.

## What I Do

I author rigs and write code to automate them on a daily basis, I also love solving problems in my head, and sometimes actually write the code to do it :)
