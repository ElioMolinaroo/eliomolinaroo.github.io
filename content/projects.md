# Projects

A selection of projects I've worked on—both personal experiments and professional contributions.

## Sculpt Processing Tools

A suite of tools to help in the authoring of sculpts for character rigging. 
Implementation of this [Pixar paper](https://graphics.pixar.com/library/sculptXfer/paper.pdf). 
More info in this blog post.

- **Stack**: Python, Maya API
- **Features**: Topology-based sculpt transfer, rest-aware relaxation, bi-Laplacian smoothing.
Supports Maya's soft selection.

## Elio Rigging Framework

A modular rigging system for Maya that focuses on speed, parallelisation, and reproducability.

- **Stack**: Python, Maya API
- **Features**: Node-graph UI to manage components creation and connections, custom Maya API wrapper to create and connect nodes and attributes.
- [See a demo](https://vimeo.com/1092559602)

## Sewers Pipeline Manager

The first suite of pipeline tools I wrote. Works inside and outside Maya and allow for project, asset, and shot creation.

- **Stack**: Python
- **Features**: Tree-like project navigation, asset creation, asset commenting, socket connection to interact with Maya.
- [See a demo](https://vimeo.com/1092915707)

## Professional Contributions

I also contribute to projects I use and care about:

- [Stim Studio](https://www.stimstudio.com) - I contributed to the auto-rigging system by adding multiple quality of life features, as well as developed some tools for rigging artists.
